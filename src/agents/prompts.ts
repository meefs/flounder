Enumerate concrete audit items. Each item must have:
- id: short slug
- location: file + line range or function/component
- securityProperty: invariant that must hold
- failureMode: one allowed tag
- why: why this spot is worth checking
- specRefs: optional list of cited spec/reference snippets
- attackerControlledInputs: optional list of inputs a malicious actor/prover controls

Grounding rules:
- Enumerate only source-backed or corpus-backed items. If the loaded material does not show the file, function, manifest, route, contract, circuit, or API, do not create an item for it.
- Every item should point to the most specific visible location available. Prefer file:line-range locations from the loaded source.
- Treat missing manifests, tests, configs, docs, or entrypoints as unknown context, not as vulnerabilities or audit items, unless the loaded material explicitly makes their absence security-relevant.
- If only a narrow source excerpt is loaded, stay within that excerpt's observable language and domain. Do not infer a web/API/dependency audit surface from a standalone circuit, contract, library, or algorithm file.
- Use the initialization learning notes as source-backed hypotheses for what must be checked, but do not treat those notes as findings.
- Derive security properties from the loaded material and configured high-level scope. Do not rely on memorized project-specific bug patterns.

Prioritize issues that match the project profile and evidence in the loaded material. Consider implementation/spec mismatch, trust-boundary mistakes, unenforced invariants, value conservation, replay or uniqueness failures, auth/session bugs, injection, SSRF, path traversal, deserialization, unsafe external calls, race conditions, consensus divergence, dependency trust, secret exposure, and cheap-to-trigger expensive work.

- Trace attacker-controlled or security-critical values through the relevant transformations, checks, constraints, state updates, and verifier or authorization decisions.
- State exactly what enforces the assigned security property, or identify the specific visible edge where enforcement is missing.
- If relevant source lines are missing from the context, return "finding": false with a needs-more-context explanation instead of guessing.

- specRefs: optional list of cited spec/reference snippets
- attackerControlledInputs: optional list of inputs a malicious actor/prover controls

Depth rules:
- Prefer items that connect two pieces of evidence not checked together in prior rounds, such as input to enforcement edge, spec statement to implementation branch, authorization identity to storage predicate, or value/state transition to conservation check.
- Follow unresolved, low-confidence, or skeptical audit observations into adjacent code and data flow instead of re-auditing the same location.
- If a prior finding depends on an assumption, enumerate the cheapest item that would refute or support that assumption.
- If the loaded source is narrow, stay within the visible source and reference material. Do not invent files, APIs, manifests, routes, dependencies, or deployment surfaces.
- Do not include an item if its normalized location, failure mode, and security property are already present in the existing checklist.
